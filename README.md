# uh-mfcs

This repository collects resources and information related to the 
**UH circle** of folks interested in the **Mathematical Foundations of Computing
Science** (MFCS).

## Topics

Here is a (tentative) list of some topics of interest to our group. 

1. lambda calculus
2. category theory
3. coalgebra and coinduction
4. intuitionistic type theory
5. functional programming and dependent types
6. automated theorem proving in Coq and/or Agda

The numbers of these topics are meant to be *immutable* (so don't change
them!); they are used below to indicate interests of members of the group.

Subject: Mathematical Foundations of Computing Science -- reading group or short course

Hello Math Grad Students,

I'd like to find out whether there are students at UH who would be
interested in a non-credit short course, or series of tutorials,
during the month of April, and possibly May, on some topics related
to the mathematical foundations of computing science.

Depending on your responses to this email, I could imagine running an
informal seminar or colloquium once per week, or if there is
significant interest, perhaps something a little more formal, like an
actual short course.

Here is a list of topics that I have in mind.  We could cover one,
possibly two, of these depending on student interest:

1. lambda calculus
2. category theory
3. coalgebra and coinduction
4. intuitionistic type theory
5. functional programming and dependent types
6. automated theorem proving in Coq and/or Agda

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in any of these areas, but I have had a
fair amount of exposure to all of them.  One of my motivations for
proposing this course is so that I can learn more about these topics
myself!

Please reply to this email if you are interested and tell me your
name, department, program, year, and, *most importantly*, put the list
of topics above in order from most interesting to least interesting.
For example, if you are very eager to learn about "5. functional
programming and dependent types," somewhat interested in "1. the
lambda calculus," and mildly interested in "2. category theory," then
you should write "Topic Preferences: 5, 1, 2."  Also, feel free to
suggest alternative related topics, if you wish.

Any other comments, criticisms, or suggestions are also welcomed.

Sincerely,

William
