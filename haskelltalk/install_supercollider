# Now you will need to setup your editor integration.
# If you're using emacs, the included .emacs file should already have the tidalcycles plugin.
# Follow the directions at https://tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html
# In particular, you need enter the following two commands in the supercollider ide before
# you start Tidalcycles.  (Press shift-enter with your cursor on each line to send each command.)
#
# include("SuperDirt")
# Now go the Language menu and click Recompile Class Library before entering the next command.
# SuperDirt.start

# If you're using atom, after you install the tidalycles plugin (and all its dependencies), 
# go to its settings and change the ghci path to
# /home/your-user-name/uh-mfc/haskelltalk/ghciscript
# For some reason atom requires an absolute path, not a relative path
