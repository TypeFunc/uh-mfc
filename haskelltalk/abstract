Title: The Joy of Functional Programming in Haskell

Abstract:
The goal of this talk is to convey to you the experience of pure joy and excitement when using Haskell, and to help you actually get started programming in Haskell.  After a basic introduction to the language, we will cover
1. The development environment and getting set up
2. More advanced language features
3. Some mathematical patterns and functional programming idioms
4. Lots of fancy demos such as plotting/visualization, LaTeX, algorithmic music generation, high performance computing, etc.
5. A little bit of theory
This will be a coding talk, so we will primarily be walking through code and actually getting set up.  The code (including installation scripts) is at https://github.com/TypeFunc/uh-mfc  I hope to cover a lot of material, so I encourage you to check it out but it isn't strictly necessary.
