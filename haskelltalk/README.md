**Title:** The Joy of Functional Programming in Haskell  
**Speaker:** Jake Fennick  
**Time:** 3pm Tuesday April 18, 2017  
**Location:** Keller 401  
**Abstract:** The goal of this talk is to convey to you the experience of pure joy
and excitement when using Haskell, and to help you actually get
started programming in Haskell.  After a basic introduction to the
language, we will cover

1. The development environment and getting set up
2. More advanced language features
3. Some mathematical patterns and functional programming idioms
4. Lots of fancy demos such as plotting/visualization, LaTeX, algorithmic music generation, high performance computing, etc.
5. A little bit of theory

This will be a coding talk, so we will primarily be walking through code and actually getting set up. The code (including installation scripts) is at https://github.com/TypeFunc/uh-mfc  I hope to cover a lot of material, so I encourage you to check it out but it isn't strictly necessary.

---------------------

This directory contains, among other things, the following files:

+ `haskelltalkoutline` --- a rough sketch of what I want to cover (eventually).  
+ `references` --- links to various learning resources. 
+ `install_linux_deb` and `install_linux_rpm` scripts for debian and red hat based Linux distributions.

Regarding the scripts:  I noted in the scripts that they may take several hours to install...  Anyhow, even as a passive listener there will be more than enough material to digest, so it's okay if people aren't installed today.  Alternatively, if people have fast machines they may be done before the end of the talk and we can continue with an interactive session afterwards.
